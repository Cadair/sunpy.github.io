title: 2nd year of SunPy participating in GSOC
author: David Pérez-Suárez

Wonderful news for the misson of SunPy to dominate the world!  This year is the 
[10th edition of Google Summer of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014)_,
and SunPy is participating again for second year in a row! 
Remember how awesome it was last year when 
[we got two amazing students]({{ site.baseurl }}{{ 2013-05-28-gsoc-community-bonding.md }})_?
Well, this year is going to be twice as awesome! Why? Because SunPy has gotten
twice as many students than in 2013.  Let's introduce them and their projects:

[Pritish Chakraborty](https://github.com/VaticanCameos) (a.k.a. VaticanCameos) 
a Computer Science student from Haryana (India) who is going to be working on giving 
SunPy a proper coordinate transformation system integrated with the currently being 
developed in [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE5.rst)_.

[Rajul Srivastava](https://github.com/rajul-iitkgp) (a.k.a. rajul), 
a science student going towards a major in chemistry in Kharagpur (India), 
is going to bring a GUI interface to SunPy. 
This GUI is going to be based in [Ginga](https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga) and 
it will help us to interact with the database.

[Rishabh Sharma](https://github.com/gunner272) (a.k.a. gunner272),
pursuing at the moment a Computer Science and Engineering degree at Hyderabad (India),
will be working during the summer on refractoring the lightcurve module, making it
more consistant with the way Map works at the moment. 
This project will also make use of Astropy development, in particular to 
the [data tables module](https://astropy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/table/index.html)_.

Last, but no less, [Ashis Panda](https://github.com/kaichogami) (a.k.a. kaichogami).
Ashis also from Hyderabad but doing a degree in electronics and telecommunications, 
will be working on ...

Don't forget to check 
[Pritish](http://thejoyofpython.wordpress.com/)_,
[Rajul](http://pettycoder.blogspot.in)_,
[Rishabh](http://rishabhsharmagunner.wordpress.com/)_ and
[Ashis's](http://sunpygsoc.wordpress.com/)_ 
blogs to be up to date on their progress during this summer and don't be
afraid to comment in their posts with words of support.  
Nevertheless, they will have also the opportunity to write here some feature posts
on to keep all of us updated.

Once more, this year GSOC would not have been possible without the help that the
[Python Software Foundation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2014) 
have given us, as we are participating under their umbrella.
Thanks PSF! In particular their organisers 
[Terri](http://terri.zone12.com/)_,
Meflin and Florian.
