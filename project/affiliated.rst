Affiliated Packages
===================

An affiliated package is a Python package related to Solar Physics that is not part of the SunPy core library, but can be included in the future as part of the SunPy project’s community.

As a community-driven project SunPy thus encourages contributions from a diverse group of people on building such software that has the potential to be a future **Affiliated SunPy Package**.

Requirements to be satisfied:

*  The package must make use of all appropriate features in the core SunPy library, to reduce code duplication and complexity.
*  The software must provide documentation that explains the function and use of the package, and this documentation should be of comparable standard to the core SunPy library.
*  The code should as far as possible provide an easy to run test suite to verify the correct operation of the package.
*  The developers of an affiliated package should engage with the rest of the SunPy community to encourage knowledge and code sharing within
   the community.
