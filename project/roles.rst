Community Role Descriptions
===========================

This section describes each of the SunPy projects community (non-board) roles, and lists the current holder(s) of that role.
Roles with no holder listed are vacant and anyone interested in filling them should contact the lead developer or anyone else with a project role.
There is no limit to how many people can share the responsibilities of a role, if you are interested in a role which is filled, contact the person and ask how you can assist them.

Lead Developer and Deputy Lead Developer
----------------------------------------

**Stuart Mumford and Will Barnes (deputy)**

The lead developer (and in their absence their nominated deputy) have overall responsibility for the core package and any sponsored affiliated packages.
The most important responsibility of the lead developer is to have high availability in the communtiy to answer questions and facilitate all contributions.

The role of the lead developer is outlined in `SEP-2 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0002.md#the-executive-director>`__ and other SEPs.
They are:

-  Hold regular meetings with the developer community (at least monthly).
-  Make regular reports to the board (at least quarterly).
-  Have push privileges to the SunPy repository and can delegate those privileges.
-  Have ownership privileges to the SunPy GitHub organization and related services.
-  Develop and maintain a submission and review process for proposed affiliated packages which must be included in the core library documentation. (`SEP-4 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0004.md#acceptance-process-for-affiliated-packages>`__)
-  Plan a release schedule and present it to the board each calendar year. (`SEP-9 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0009.md#detailed-description>`__)

In the governance documents the lead developer is given all the executive responsibilities of running the development side of the SunPy organization.
This roles page splits up these responsibilities, and other related activities, into many roles to share the workload.
The lead developer is expected to assist people who have named roles and ensure that they are happy to continue to fill those roles.

Affiliated Package Liason
-------------------------
**Unfilled**

SunPy is starting to develop a set of general affiliated packages, i.e ndcube, sunkit-image and drms as well as instrument specific ones like IRISPy.
Affiliated packages are not very structured currently, although a framework for them exists in
`SEP-4 <https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy-SEP/blob/master/SEP-0004.md#acceptance-process-for-affiliated-packages>`__.

This role would develop a set of processes for both sponsored and non-sponsored affiliated packages, a review procedure for new affiliated packages, and lead the effort to integrate instrument teams with SunPy.

**Commitment Level**: This role needs an investment of time at the beggining to set up the processes for affiliated packages. These processes would then determine the likely time commitment after that.
