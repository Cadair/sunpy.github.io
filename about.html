<!-- History
================================================== -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="history">Our Mission</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">The SunPy project is a free and open-source software library for 
solar physics.</p>
  <p>SunPy is a community-developed free and open-source software package for solar physics. SunPy is meant to be a free alternative to the <a href="http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/">SolarSoft</a> data analysis environment which is based on the <a href="http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx">IDL</a> scientific programming language sold by Exelis. Though SolarSoft is open-source IDL is not and can be prohibitively expensive.
  The aim of the SunPy project is to provide the software tools necessary so that anyone can analyze solar data. SunPy is written using the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python programming language</a> and is build upon the scientific Python environment which includes the core packages <a href="http://numpy.org">NumPy</a>, <a>SciPy</a>. The development of SunPy is associated with that <a href="http://astropy.org">Astropy</a>. SunPy was first created in 2011 by a small group of scientists and developers at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/">NASA 
  Goddard Space Flight Center</a> on nights and weekends.

    <h1 id="acknowledging">Acknowledging or Citing SunPy</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">If you have used SunPy in your scientific work we would appreciate it if you would acknowledge it.</p>
  <p>The continued growth and development of SunPy is dependent on the community being 
  aware of the use SunPy. If you use SunPy, we therefore ask that you acknowledge SunPy 
  appropriately in a publication or presentation (poster or talk).
  <ul>
  <li><b>For a publication</b>, we recommend the following line be added to the conclusion or acknowledgements<br><br>
    <i>This research has made use of SunPy, an open-source and free community-developed solar data analysis package written in Python (citation).</i><br><br>
    where the citation is to the <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2013/mumford.html">SunPy paper</a>  (<a href="http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2013/bib/mumford.bib">Bib reference</a>) presented at <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2013/">Scipy 2013</a>. 
    The paper is open access. If the journal allows please also include a link to sunpy.org. 
    If you have the time please <a href="sunpy%40googlegroups.com">email us</a> to let us know about your paper as we maintain a 
    <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/sunpy_-_python_for_solar_physicists">public list</a> of papers on <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>.
</li>
   <li><b>For a poster, talks, or project websites</b>, please include the Sunpy logo on the title, conclusion slide, or about page. For websites please link the image to sunpy.org.

<!-- Versus
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="versus">SunPy versus SolarSoft</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">SunPy is an alternative to the popular SolarSoft analysis environment</p>
  <p>The IDL-based SolarSoft analysis environment is a mature and rich code base to do Solar physics. Unfortunately not every person or institution have the capital necessary to fund a yearly IDL license. With the rise of scientific computing in Python new tools
  are now available to make developing the basics of a solar data analysis environment straightforward.

  <p class="lead">Part of SunPy has been developed with help from the Google and ESA Summer of Code programs.</p>
  <p>Part of the development of SunPy has been generously supported by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSOC) as well as the 
  <a href="http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2013/">European Space Agency Summer of Code in Space</a> (SOCIS). Both of these programs
  have funded several students to work on SunPy for a few months (usually during the summer).
