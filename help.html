<!-- Documentation
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">

  </div>
  <p>The SunPy <a href="https://sunpy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/">documentation</a> 
  should be your first stop to get your question answered. We strive to provide
  a rich and comprehensive set of docs. The documentation is included in the code itself
  which you can access through <a href="https://sunpy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/reference/index.html">code reference</a> 
  and we also have a number of <a href="https://sunpy.readthedocs.org/en/stable/guide/index.html">guides</a> which take
  you through specific topics. If you do not find your answer there read on!

<!-- The Mailing list
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="list">The Mailing list</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Sometimes the best way to get your question answered is just by asking someone. 
  SunPy has two mailing lists; a general mailing list for general issues and a developer
  mailing list. If you have a general question about how SunPy works use the main list.
  If, on the other hand, you have a question about the inner workings of SunPy or 
  how SunPy is organized or have a question about developing some new feature please use
  the developer mailing list.
  </p>

<!-- Chat Room
============================ -->
<div class="bs-docs-section">
  <div class="page-header">
    <h1 id="chat">Live Chat</h1>
  </div>
  <p>
  We have a chat room on IRC (#sunpy) hosted on <a href="http://freenode.net">freenode</a> where you can talk 
  with SunPy users and developers in real time. If you are unfamiliar with IRC we 
  recommend you simply use Freenode's <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=astropy">web chat client</a> which will open directly in your browser.
  Stop by and say hello. Also, most chat programs can connect to the chat room (hostname = irc.freenode.net, channel = #sunpy).
